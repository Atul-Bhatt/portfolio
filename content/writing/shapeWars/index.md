Everything on this table is rectangular. Phone, notebooks, books, laptop. Even copier paper that I’m writing on is rectangular. Rectangular things are convenient. This room is rectangular and so is my doormat. What the fuck is wrong with this shape. What happened to all the other shapes? Where are the triangles and circles and hexagons and what not. If I want to look at circular objects I’ll have to go to the kitchen. Plates, pans, pressure cooker. Holes are always circular. Think of any hole you’ve ever seen, they’re all circular (yeah, including that one). Triangles, they’re truly fucked. You’ll never see triangles anywhere. Triangles don’t have any practical applications. Soon triangles will be on unemployment strike asking for 10 percent quota on the shapes of new inventions.

Things weren’t always like this. There was a time when triangles employed humans to make pyramids. Nobody had the guts to question the uselessness of such pointy structures. Triangles believed in totalitarian government because of their inherent hierarchical shape. But this form of government was bound to fail. Rectangles took over the world with their dominant practical applications. Circles had tires to protect their heritage. Triangles had nothing. They were on the brink of extinction. They had to depend on inter-shapial marriages. They married circles to produce a much useful shape known as cone. They insisted on the construction of turret (conical) and skillion (shed) roof homes to symbolically dominate other shapes by being on top of them.

While the privileged Right Triangles were busy paying Pythagoras to discover a new theorem for them. Rectangles got a copyright on books, making sure they were always printed in rectangular shapes. After they realized people have stopped reading books, they got copyright on smartphones and laptops.

It’s only a matter of time before triangles come back. This time they will wipe out all the other shapes from this planet. Till then, enjoy your triangular sandwich.
