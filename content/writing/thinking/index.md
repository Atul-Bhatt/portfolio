Am I in someone else’s head right now the same way I am thinking about all these people? People on the street who’re making all this noise, that girl in the coffee shop, family, people I used to work with, people I went to college with, that guy who made tea for me at the shop that I frequent. There are so many people this world and there’s so many things they must be thinking of. Like right now I’m thinking of buying a table lamp so I won’t have to turn on this frighteningly huge LED which lights up this living room.

There must be someone in this world who’s thinking of me at this moment. They say you get hiccups whenever someone’s thinking of you. What if I don’t do anything about those hiccups and they’re forced to think of me until they knock on my door and beg me to drink some water so they can think of something else and get on with their lives.

Ever think how many things you’d have to explain if someone else had access to your thoughts? I bet some nutjob neuroscientist is working on a device that’ll give you access to a person’s thoughts. ( I searched for neuro scientist on google to see if there’s a space or a hyphen between neuro and scientist. First thing that came up was an article in New York Post — “I went from neuroscientist to stripper and now I’m rich with no regrets.” I read it, because, you know, stripper.) There’ll come a time when you can download an app and wirelessly get access to someone else’s thoughts. And then whenever you’re sitting in a coffee shop and suspect someone’s listening to your thoughts, you’d have to think of a really funny joke and if they start to laugh you can walk up there and punch them in the throat.

Makes you wonder what kind of things you are hiding from people in your head.
