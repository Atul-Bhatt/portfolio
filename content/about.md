> True heroism is minutes, hours, weeks, year upon year of quite, precise, judicious exercise of probity and care--with no one there to see or cheer. This is the world.

<cite style="margin-left: 360px;">&mdash; David Foster Wallace</cite>

### Year 2024
A lot has changed over the last 12 months. I've started working in Rust and Golang.

### Past
My past experience might look weird at first but when I look back, I feel like couldn't have made better choices. When I graduated from high school I had to wait for a year to get education loan from the bank to get into a University and get a degree in Computer Science. After graduating from college I joined SAP Labs India and they allowed me to pursue Masters of Technology from Bits Pilani on weekends.

After staying there for two and a half years, I didn't see much value in the degree or the challenges I was presented with at the company. There was nothing wrong with either the degree or the company itself. I just wanted something more from life. I wanted that fantasy life that I'd imagined in college where a guy sits in front of a computer for hours and you know he's doing something world class. 

### Present
Being an autodidact I realized I could learn more by building a software than a degree. That's what I've been doing these days. I try to write as much code as possible. I also like writing short stories and thought snippets. I share them on medium and they're also present in the "Writing" section of this website.

### Future
I assure you I'm not being pretentious when I say I want to work in a place where people are building software that truly shapes the future. If you are reading this, thank you for giving me your precious attention.
